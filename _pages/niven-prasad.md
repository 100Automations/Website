bio-description: Product Manager for 100 Automations. Problem-solver with 8+ years of as a corporate lawyer around the world, 2+ years as a product manager and leader at early stage startups and technology institutions in San Francisco. Super curious learner and loves collaborating with others to build things that have a positive impact!

Quote: There is so much value created by work done in open source projects, a lot of which can be packaged up and used in other projects. I'm proud to be on a team helping capture and package that work done in the form of automations, so that open source projects everywhere and those working on reap all the rewards from this work!

Internal Motivations: To bring a product to life that has a positive and outsize impact on society.

External Motivations: Building the site has allowed me to think closely about open source development and empathize more closely with open source developers, projects, the use cases, as well as all the edge cases in this space. My role as product manager has given me an insight on the user but also working cross-functionally and collaboratively with design, engineering, project management, and everyone else involved in making this product come to life!
