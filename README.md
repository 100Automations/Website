# 100Automations Website

100Automations is a project of Hack for LA that showcases automations and microservices that reduce repetitive work in open source development; a project where anyone can create, collaborate on, and get credit for high-value open source contributions to the wider Civic Tech community. The name derives from the projectâ€™s goal to reach 100 developed automations in our first twelve months.

The 100Automations website is a standard [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted right here on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). To develop the site, you'll need to first clone the repository on to your computer. For further instructions on developing the site, see the [Overview section of the Hack for LA website README](https://github.com/hackforla/website).
