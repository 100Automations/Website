# 100 Automations Website

100 Automations is a project of Hack for LA that showcases automations and microservices that reduce repetitive work in open source development; a project where anyone can create, collaborate on, and get credit for high-value open source contributions to the wider Civic Tech community. The name derives from the projectâ€™s goal to reach 100 developed automations in our first twelve months.

The 100 Automations website is going to be a standard [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted right here on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).  We will be providing further instructions after we have our first initial code.
