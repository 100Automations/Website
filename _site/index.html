<p>100 Automations is a project of Hack for LA that showcases automations and microservices that reduce repetitive work in open source development; a project where anyone can create, collaborate on, and get credit for high-value open source contributions to the wider Civic Tech community. The name derives from the projectâ€™s goal to reach 100 developed automations in our first twelve months.</p>

<p>The 100 Automations website is going to be a standard <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site hosted right here on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>.  We will be providing further instructions after we have our first initial code.</p>
