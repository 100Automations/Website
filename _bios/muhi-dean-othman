bio-description: I am a full-stack web developer who is dedicated to creating cutting edge interface friendly applications. I took the California High School Proficiency exam, and began attending Golden West College,2010, at 16.

I transferred to the University of California Davis in 2013, and left in 2015.I did not have a degree and, I worked part-time jobs to get by, but I didn't feel I was going anywhere.

In 2019 I decided I would pursue a career in web development. I wanted a career change that was challenging and exciting, but I found service design to be my top priority. I received my certificate from The University of California, Irvine in web development, May 2020.

Now I am a part of developing 100 Automations. I am attending the University of California, Davis, and I expect to graduate March 19, 2021 with a Bachelors in Arts, Political Science.

I am hoping to become more involved with the community, and assist others where I can. I also hope to make new connections with people.
