bio-description: I’m a researcher, designer, and web developer who wants to help artists and non-profits use technology to achieve their goals. I’ve been an instructional technologist at Pomona College, Technical Coordinator for the Calarts School of Critical Studies, and board member of Machine Project, an arts non-profit in Los Angeles. I’m currently the executive janitor at Betalevel, a basement in Chinatown.

quote: There isn’t really a good place to go ask someone to make the tool that fits your need. 100 Automations is a unique resource where developers actually want you to.

internal-motivations: I’ve often had to fill in all the roles on project—designer, developer, server admin. Working on 100 Automations project lets me learn from the deep expertise of everyone on the team and gain experience in collaborative development.

external-motivations: Working with technology-averse faculty, I’ve called myself only half-jokingly a therapist. No one is inherently “bad” at technology, and I always find it rewarding to frame the tools in more relevant ways and make them easier to use.
