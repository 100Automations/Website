internal-motivations: I've always been an advocate for productivity, whether through outsourcing or technology. Working on this site excites me as I think of all the time-saving projects I will discover.

external-motivations: Humans built machines to help us do tasks. Automations help those machines do the tasks more efficiently. An index of automations will help more machines have automations so more tasks can be completed.
