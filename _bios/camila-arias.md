bio-description: I'm a Jack of all Trades, I like learning and experimenting in different disciplines. I enjoy solving problems for people and making things work better, and getting involved in any of the phases of building those solutions. I've got a background in Electronics and Programming, so when I began studying Multimedia Design in Uni, I coded games, art installations, augmented reality experiences,... Then I started doing more design and I ended up freelancing as Visual and Graphic Designer. Last couple years I've been working on UI/UX Design, and participating on projects that allow me to get experience also as a Product Manager, and collaborating closely with Engineering, Biz Dev and QA. I also enjoy working with remote international teams and meeting awesome people!

quote: If you can do it once, an automation can do it forever!

internal-motivations: I joined to get more experience as a designer in a bigger, cross-functional team, and because I loved the idea of 100 Automations.

external-motivations: It's exciting to think how much of an impact this project could make, the contributions to 100 Automations can potentially generate a constantly expanding impact that we can't tell how far it could go! Many civic-tech projects and beyond could leverage the automations built and streamline progress thanks to this project.
