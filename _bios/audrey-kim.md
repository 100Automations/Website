bio-description: Hi, my name is Audrey and I'm a Content Writer at 100 Automations. I'm a recent grad from UC Berkeley (Go Bears!) with a BA in English. Before graduating, I worked at HarperOne as an Editorial Intern, and taught writing to ESL students. I'm excited to get to work with others and make a positive contribution to my community!

quote: I always end up looking for ways to work efficiently. I hope 100 Automations will be of help to people like me, who want to make an impact on the world while saving time!

internal-motivations: Going to school at Cal, I was always surrounded by the tech world, but never totally immersed in it. I'm curious about tech and communication, so it's exciting to be part of a project that brings the two together.

external-motivations: Being a part of this project as the content writer has allowed me to rethink about the role of words in tech. No matter what project, communication is an essential piece of the puzzle. I hope to help convey ideas that can make an impact on the civic tech community and open source developers.
