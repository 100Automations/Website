bio-description: Hi! I'm a member of the Product Management team here at 100 Automations, and the International Roaming Manager at a TelCo here in Paraguay. I have worked as a Software.Engineer and as a GSM Network engineer for 8+ years. A few years ago I've also been a Sales Rep - a fun way to meet new people. In the early 2000's I went to college for an Electronics Engineering degree but ended up getting a Marketing one in 2014. Still, always involved with the tech community and proud of being part of such an impactful Open Source Project like this. Besides work, I enjoy playing football (soccer) and going to live concerts. On vacations, I usually go to the beach and I love discovering new places.
quote: Instead of reinventing the wheel, let's focus our time building upon it.
internal-motivations: I want to learn from new technologies and new ways to collaborate with remote and Open Source teams.
external-motivations: I feel this is a way to give back to the community and to have an impact on the Open Source projects of the future.
