title: GHA Add Issue to Project
description: This GitHub Action (GHA), is designed to move issues to a specific column based on criteria such as a specific label, or specific phrase in the issue's body. This will prove helpful for members of a team who manages a GitHub project board, such as project managers, by lessening errors and organizing workflow. By design, it abstracts a lot of the configuration into one file, making customization simple for team members who are not adept to coding syntax.
