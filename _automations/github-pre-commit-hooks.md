title: Pre-commit Hooks Starter Kit
description: Pre-commit hooks are a simple way to check your code for any issues before committing your code to Github. It could be something as simple as removing extra spaces from the end of a file to verifying that the code you want to commit is valid Python or does not contain any secrets or access tokens. Pre-Commit Hooks can be written in a number of languages including Python, Ruby, and Rust but this automation focuses on Python.
