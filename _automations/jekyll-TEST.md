# 'identification' is the 9 digit ID for your repo in the GitHub API.
identification: '171717171'
title: TEST CARD
description: When using Github and Jekyll it is easy to end up with files that are missing data types, with no built in way to enforce uniformity. The Jekyll-Gather-Data-Types automation creates reports that identify what data types are being used across all files in a collection and what might be missing from individual files in order to target code for remediation. Future functionality could include providing the option of using GitHub actions to prevent incomplete files from being committed (PRs).
