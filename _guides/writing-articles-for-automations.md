# Writing an Article for Your Automation
If you're thinking about writing an article about your automation, start here!
A great article increases your visibility as a developer, and opens room for peer review. 
It also gives users detailed examples on ways to use your code.

## General Tips
- Provide links to references or background knowledge if possible.
- Explain jargons when you use them so that beginners can understand your process.

## Keywords
- SEO tips that could help articles show up on top of search engines (needs more research)

## Language & Readability
- It's always a good idea to double-check for spelling and grammar before publishing. 
- Use spelling and grammar checkers, such as [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/grammar-check).
- Break down long sentences and paragraphs. [Hemmingway](http://hemingwayapp.com/) is a great readability tool that flags complicated sentences.
- Spell out acronyms the first time you use them. 
1. Example: HfLA (Hack for LA)
- Before publishing, ask for an extra pair of eyes to read over your article.

## Title
- The title is short (less than 25 words) and gives a solution to a problem. 
- The title should grab the reader's attention.

- Good Examples ([Writing technical articles: tips for programmers - Dev](https://dev.to/iriskatastic/writing-technical-articles-tips-for-programmers-29gp)):

## Subtitle

## Header Image

## Introduction

## Body
- Briefly explain how to set up your automation.
- Give examples of how your automation can be used in different programs.
- You know the saying: a picture is worth a thousand words. Give visualizations (screenshots, end results, illustrations, workflow charts, etc.) to back up your explanations and break up large blocks of text. The more relevant pictures you have in your article, the better you'll be able to get your points across.
- Separate large blocks of text under headings.

## Conclusion
