# Preparing Your Automation for Publication

## Instructions
This is what weâ€™ll need from you to prepare your automation for publication on the website: 

### Image
A 600 x 400 image that illustrates the automation.  

Example 1:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37763229/92680204-258f5280-f2df-11ea-9946-27d222bddf15.png" width=200px>

### Alt image text
This is some text that helps people who cannot see the image understand what the image portrays

Example 1: 
> Some GitHub profile Images of people who have contributed to the hackforla.org website and titles under some names indicating Designer, Stakeholder, Product all in uppercase text.

Example 2: 
>Jekyll logo with test tube and words Gather Data Types all in green.
