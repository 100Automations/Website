## Steps to add an existing automation to 100 Automations:

1. Create a new repository under the 100 Automations - [quick link here](https://github.com/organizations/100Automations/repositories/new)

2. Ensure the repository contains, at a minimum:
- A Readme
- Licence: we use the GNU General Public License v2.0 at Hack for LA [**Double-check this**]
- A Code of Conduct.md
- A Security.md
- A Support.md
- A Contributing.md

3.  Once the repository is complete with documentation and the automation code, complete [this automation card template](https://github.com/100Automations/futureautomations/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation%2C+review&template=-automation-proposal.md&title=%5BAutomation+Name%5D+Proposal) in the Future Automations repo and move it to the [Review column](https://github.com/100Automations/futureautomations/projects/1#column-9876980)

4. If you prefer completing the automation card template over multiple sessions, place it in the [In Progress column](https://github.com/100Automations/futureautomations/projects/1#column-9876974) on the Future Automations board

5. Once the repo and template card are ready for review, the 100 Automations team will reach out to partner on getting the materials together to get the automation ready for the 100 Automations website. You will use [this automation materials template](https://github.com/100Automations/futureautomations/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation%2C+good+first+issue&template=create-automation-card-for--automation-name-.md&title=Create+automation+card+for+%5Bautomation+name%5D) for this purpose.
