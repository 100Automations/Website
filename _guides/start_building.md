# Start Building

## Want to Build an Automation?
You can help build automations that are at different phases and find opportunities that suit your level:

1. You have your own idea and you want to build it yourself
2. You want to build an automation from scratch but don’t have your own idea
3. You want to contribute to an automation that’s already being developed

See below for how to get started!

## Build Your Own Automation
So you have an idea for an automation and want to build it yourself? You can either fill out this [Automation Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGJrU92Tj5Ft763MMWpSwyB6VqctPXzu8WKIy4xTjf1nJg0Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

If you use the Automation Form, one of the 100 Automations team will take the information, create an issue card for you in the automation creation workflow in GitHub, and reach out to you once that is ready.

If you use the Automation Proposal template, our [automation workflow overview](https://github.com/100Automations/futureautomations/wiki/Workflow-Guide-for-Ideators) will help you get an understanding of how you can use this to develop automations.

When your automations get to the "In progress" phase of the workflow, be sure to read our [Guide on Creating an Automation Repo](url) to get you set up at the build phase.

## Build From Automations Log
Don't have your own idea? We have a log of well-developed and documented automation ideas vetted by the 100 Automations team that need development. So you can jump right in and start developing.

To find an automation you'd like to build, go to the [Automations Log here](https://github.com/100Automations/futureautomations/projects/1#column-9876973), self-assign yourself on the issue, and move it to the In Progress (actively working) column. 


## Improve An Automation
Some automations are already in development but still need help. Click on the "needs help" part of an automation card on our home page and see what type of help is needed for that automation. To find out more about an automation, click on the Readme button. 

Here is the [anatomy of an automation card](https://github.com/100Automations/Website/blob/gh-pages/_guides/project_card_anatomy.md) to hep you navigate around automations on our homepage.

## Need help at any stage?
If you need help at any stage of the build process, be sure to move your automation card in the [Futureautomations board](https://github.com/100Automations/futureautomations/projects/1) to the [Questions for the 100 Automations Team](https://github.com/100Automations/futureautomations/projects/1#column-12391599){target="_blank"} column.

If your automation needs help, in the form of peer review, maintenance, support for users, refactoring, or documentation, make sure to apply the "Needs help" and the type of help labels to your automation card.

Happy developing!
