# How to suggest a guide for 100 Automations

## General Notes

### Keep it DRY
So that you don't duplicate work, check for guides that are already written or have been suggested at this link:
https://github.com/100Automations/Website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22feature%3A+guides%22

### Get in touch if you need to
You can join the [Hack for LA slack](http://hackforla.org/slack) and message us in our team channel #100automations


## Help with Existing Guides and Guide Suggestions

### Update an existing guide
Have you found a typo or do you want to suggest an improvement to an existing guide?  If so, go to the bottom of the guide page and click on the link for editing.  This will give you an editor and allow you to open a pull request with your suggested changes.  Note, you will need to be able to edit in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

### Help us prioritize our backlog
If you do find a guide suggestion in our issues, but that has not yet been worked on, feel free to add a comment or emoji indicating your interest in its creation, so we can prioritize suggestions with the most interest.

### Help us write guides other people have suggested

**Backlog:** 
If there is a suggestion for a guide, in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/100Automations/Website/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22feature%3A+guides%22#column-9876552), that you would like to write up, add a comment to the issue asking our current PM to assign you the issue using the following text:
 "@NivenPrasad please add assign me this issue". 

Once you receive a confirmation you can submit a PR with the following text:
 "Fixes Issue # "  
example: Fixes issue #1 .  

If you have questions before you put in a PR, please put any questions or comments in the issue and @ message the PM.

**Icebox:**
If the issue is in the icebox that means it's not a fully fleshed out proposal, if you want to help us fix that, rewrite the issue in a comment.  And @ message our PM "@NivenPrasad please review and if approved, add this issue to the prioritized backlog"


## Suggest a new guide idea
If there is no guide for the topic you want, use this: [form](https://github.com/100Automations/Website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation%2C+feature%3A+guides&template=suggest-a-guide.md&title=Suggest+a+guide%3A+%5Bname+of+guide+here%5D) to suggest it

### How would you like to be credited?

- Name?
- Github Handle?
- LinkedIn profile?
- etc?

Credit assignment is at the 100Automations teams discretion, we will document our decision making process in the issue.  Our intention is always to provide credit where possible for work that grows the open source community.
