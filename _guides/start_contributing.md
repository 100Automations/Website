## What does it mean to contribute

Instead of creating and working on your own automation, you might want to jump in and help on someone else's idea that is already in flight.

Depending on the stage of automation and what level you are, automations need different kinds of help such as: 

- refactoring 
- maintaining 
- development 
- advice 
- peer review

## How to contribute

The automation cards on our website will tell you what stage an automation is and how you can help or contribute. If you want to know more about any of the details on these cards, you can look at the [anatomy of an automation card].

All the automations to be worked on live in GitHub so if you're not set up with GitHub make sure you are before you jump into contributing.

To contribute:
- Click on the Readme for the automation on our Home page
  - Read the readme
  - Read the contributing.md for the repo
  - Look at what issues are open
  - Reach out to the owner of that repo (or as otherwise directed by the readme) to let them know you are wanting to contribute to the project!

## Who can contribute?

While the bulk of the work with an automation generally rests with developers, there might well be issues related to project management, documentation, content writing, or product management that an automation could use some help with. So if you're curious and not necessarily a developer, feel free to browse the Readme for the relevant automation for more info!

## What do you get for contributing?

The 100 Automations project gives developers visibility and credit for their work by highlighting contributor profiles on our website. 

In addition, contributing to an automation can have multiple benefits in your growth and career:
- Level up your programming skills
- Contribute meaningfully to a civic technology project
- Build mentee or mentor relationships with other developers

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the 100 Automations team at 100automations@hackforla.org. We look forward to supporting you in your contributions!
