### Motivations
#### Personal/ Englightend Self-interest (Internal Motivation): 
What personally motivates you to create automations and contribute to our platform? 
 (e.g. to grow certain skills, increase visibility, give back to the community, etc.)

**Example 1:**

> I'm motivated by my drive to grow as a developer – I want to strengthen my skills in Python and Jekyll, and I want to learn how to write good, clean code by contributing to a platform with high standards. I also want to work with like-minded people who use and want to improve open-source code.

#### Community Impact (External Motivation): 
What around you motivates you to create automations for the open-source community? Was it out of annoyance or need? 

**Example 1:**

> In 2020, the pandemic drove us to work at home, and we spent more hours on open-source work. But how do we make our work sustainable over the long run? Automations will help us achieve efficiency in open-source collaborations.
