## Quote 
A quote from you about automations. Add your personal flair!

**Example 1:**

> "Automations allow us to focus on being productive instead of busy.”



## Motivations

### Internal Motivation
This is your Englightend Self-interest. What personally motivates you to create automations and contribute to our platform? 
(e.g. to grow certain skills, increase visibility, give back to the community, etc.)

**Example:**
> I'm motivated by my drive to grow as a developer – I want to strengthen my skills in Python and Jekyll, and I want to learn how to write good, clean code by contributing to a platform with high standards. I also want to work with like-minded people who use and want to improve open-source code.

### External Motivation 
This is the Community Impact you want to have. What around you motivates you to create automations for the open-source community? Was it out of annoyance or need? 

**Example:**
> In 2020, the pandemic drove us to work at home, and we spent more hours on open-source work. But how do we make our work sustainable over the long run? Automations will help us achieve efficiency in open-source collaborations.



###  Picture
