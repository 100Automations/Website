### Workflow Guide for Ideators

## The New Ideas Ice Box
If you have a new idea even in the form of a passing thought, create an issue card and put it here. Don't know what makes a good automation? Don't worry, we've got [a guide to help you](https://github.com/100Automations/Website/blob/master/_guides/self-evaluating-new-automation-idea.md).

## The Half-baked Ideas Prioritized Backlog
Ideas that are more fully formed beyond an initial "just a thought" go here.  If an issue card is here, it means no one is actively developing this idea further so these are up for grabs!

## Idea Iteration in Progress
These are ideas that someone is actively completing the pre-development requirements for. These pre-development requirements, like [creating good readme's](https://github.com/100Automations/Website/blob/master/_guides/creating-good-readmes-for-automations.md) or [setting up good health files](https://github.com/100Automations/Website/blob/master/_guides/community-support-for-automations.md) are designed to ensure our automations meet good minimum quality standards and promote better development practices as the automation gets developed.

## Questions for the 100 Automations Team
The 100 Automations team is here to support you through the creation process and this part of the workflow allows you to communicate with the team on any issues specific to an automation proposal.

## 100 Automations Quality Team Signoff
Once an automation proposal is completed for pre-development requirements, it moves here to be checked by the 100 Automations Quality team to, again, ensure quality standards in the creation process.
