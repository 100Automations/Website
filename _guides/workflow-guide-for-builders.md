### Workflow Guide for Builders

## Prioritized Backlog
After pre-development requirements are signed off on, proposals become ready to be developed. So if you're a builder and looking for an automation that has good documentation and requirements, then this is your place to go, self-assign an issue and start building!

## Review
The 100 Automations team will do a final review of the automation for workability and quality standards before it will be categorized as done.

## Will not be worked on
Inevitably with the creation process, there are times when an automation has already been created or it has stopped in its tracks at an early stage where the person working on it cannot be reached for some time for whatever reason. In those rare occasions, we will move automations to this part of the workflow.
