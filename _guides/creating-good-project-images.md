# Creating a Good Project Image


## General Design Tips
<!-- was bold \/-->
The project image is 744 x 300 pixels, but displays at half that size, so it needs to be a clear, simple identifier of your automation.

- Try to convey a sense of your project at a glance. 
- A few distinct colors and an icon may be all you need.
- You might not need any text. If you do use it, keep it short and large. 


## Use Clear Images
<!-- was bold \/-->
Bold, simple images usually work best
- The project image isn’t very large, and may be seen on small screens.
- Consider using icons and “flat” art.
- If using photo, keep it simple. Consider cropping complex images down to a clear compelling detail.


## Image Rights and Credits
<!-- was bold \/-->
Only use art and images that you have the rights to re-use
- Do not use an image that you found in search without identifying the source and use rights. 
- The safest images to use are public domain or CC0. You can do whatever you want with these, without attribution. 
- You can use images licensed to require attribution (eg: CC-BY) as long as you [give credit to the artist](https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/attribution/){:target="_blank"}  in your project
- Don’t use any company or software logos without checking their usage guidelines. (eg:  [GitHub's logo guidelines](https://github.com/logos){:target="_blank"} ask that you not use their logo in your project images)

How to credit images:
 - It's best practice to credit image sources when possible, even if not required.
 - Your project ReadMe file is the best place to credit your sources.
 - The image credit should contain the following information:
>  - Title
>  - Creator
>  - Linked source
>  - License
